# Importing-plotting-data-with-prompts

In importseis, the user is prompted to input the time range of seismic data to import and plot, and from which seismic station. Hour-long files of seismic data are successively opened and plotted as individual subplots. The number of subplots created depends on the time range of the data requested to be plotted. 

Please note that the data associated with importseis.py can not be shared, and so has not been uploaded to Github.
